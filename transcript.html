  <h1>Transcript: Tell YOUR Story with Photography</h1>

  <p>I will never forget this moment not only because I have the pictures but because of all the conversations and the good times on the trail that this represents.</p>

  <p>A lot of the time we can get carried away with just posting photos on Instagram and not really diving deep into either the meaning of the photo or maybe something special that happened to get that photo.</p>

  <p>Maybe the weather was crazy and you have to get up early in the morning to get to your special photo spot, or maybe you had to use a completely new photo technique that you've never used before.</p>

  <p>So regardless of what you or what other people think of your photos — every photo has a story, every photo has a meaning, and in one way or another it's going to be special to you and the people that you were with when you took that photo.</p>

  <p>Anyways, that's it for this Photo Friday. Like I said, I'm going to make this a series going forward — whether I do just talk about the story behind the photo, or show like a speed run edit of that photo, or maybe a technique, or even maybe bring in some people who were part of the photo that I shot — I think that would really be fun.</p>

  <p>If that's something you want to see, go ahead leave a comment or hit the like button. That lets me know that you like this video and tells YouTube that you thought this video was worth watching.</p>

  <p>And until next time, take care.</p>
